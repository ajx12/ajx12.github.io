- then clear the played hand array


How to remove the cards from the available hand:

- go through each "disabled" card in the available-hand html elements and remove their picture

- at the same time when removing a picture, take note of the png image path, and compare it to the available-hand array elements.

- append elements from the deck to the end of the available-hand array

- fill in the pictures / set the pictures to be the ones from the array.
